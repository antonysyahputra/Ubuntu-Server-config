Configure Static IP address on Server
In this example we will set a static IP address on the Ubuntu 22.04 server to 192.168.1.202/24 with default gateway to 192.168.1.1 and DNS servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, 
and 192.168.1.1.

Locate and edit with administrative privileges the /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml file with the following configuration. Update your desired static IP address, DNS server and gateway where appropriate:
# This file is generated from information provided by
# the datasource.  Changes to it will not persist across an instance.
# To disable cloud-init's network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}

network:
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses: [192.168.1.202/24]
            gateway4: 192.168.1.1
            nameservers:
              addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4,192.168.1.1]
    version: 2

    
Save and exit the file when done.

UPDATE
========

instead :
            gateway4: 192.168.1.1
 to :  
            routes:
                - to: default
                  via: 10.10.20.1
